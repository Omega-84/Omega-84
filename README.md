### Hi there 👋


**Omega-84/Omega-84** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tensorflow and fast.ai
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on computer vision projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with image processing
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm not from a technical background.
